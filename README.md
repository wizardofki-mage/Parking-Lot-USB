# Parking-Lot-USB
This is a portfolio activity that is part of the Coursera/Google Cybersecurity certification. It asks students to develop an "attacker mindset" for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities that could occur if someone (especially an employee or hacker) found a USB stick in the parking lot of a fictional Rhetorical Hospital.
